## Installation

_this theme is written in SCSS and split to multiple files so it can **not** work with betterdiscord (at least for now)_

#### Powercord

1. clone the repo in the themes folder `git clone https://github.com/Aokiare/dracula`
2. enable dracula by typing `.theme enable dracula` or use [Theme Toggler](https://github.com/redstonekasi/theme-toggler)
